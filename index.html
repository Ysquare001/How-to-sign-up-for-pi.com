			<h1>What is pi ?</h1>
			<p>Pi is a cryptocurrency (Digital Currency) such as Bitcoin, Etherium, Dodge coins e.t.c (incase if you have not heard of these, they are also cryptocurrencies). These cryptocurrencies can basically be called "the money of the future". Pi can be obtained/earned (mined) very esily. Pi is special because right now it can be mined while other cryptocurrencies cannot be mined. You may be wondering why other cryptocurrencies cannot be mined and this is because they have been launched and can be traded with. Presently, pi has not been launched so you can mine. Very soon, the mining rate will drop and keep dropping until you can no longer mine again and this is when it will be launched SO YOU BETTER START MINING NOW!!!. When it is launched, a level of scarcity will be created because people can no longer mine which thereby increases it's value and this is when the people who had mined before will be able to use it to trade SO BETTER START MINING NOW!!!.</p>
